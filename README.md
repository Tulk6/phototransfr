Made to do a slideshow with all the photos from this year with my friends. A web page is hosted locally which displays the photos from the year, and which is synced across all devices, such that it can be displayed on a computer and then controlled from a phone, and if anybody wants to download a photo, all they have to do is visit the page and save the image!

In order to use, photos must be placed into the static/photos folder, numbered sequentially from 0 in the order that they will be displayed (right now they must also be jpg). This can be done from a DCIM folder using the photo_indexer.py program. Next, run the phototransfr.py file, which will launch the server on port 4664 and the devices hostname. Visiting this address will show a page with the photo, buttons for previous and next, a fullscreen button, and a text box with a 'jump' button. Also displayed are the photos index, datetime, and description. Pressing entering an index and pressing jump will skip to the photo with that index. 

My first web project, and so also first with websockets. Not v well made but works. Web sockets r v fun.
